# resizable-react-containers
Two side by side content containers, resizable via the separating bar. In addition, elements inside each can be exactly positioned relative to their container in CSS. That is, 0, 0 is top left, and negative and high numbers will overflow. Elements will overflow if their sizes extend beyond the borders.

This containers at least implement the functionality of CodePen's 3x1 horizontal display mode. Styles can be updated via React style components (as here) or one could add specific classes to the CSS. 

Acknowledgment: https://github.com/1milligram/html-dom/blob/master/public/demo/create-resizable-split-views/index.html/; this inspired the basic geometric logic for the resizing.
